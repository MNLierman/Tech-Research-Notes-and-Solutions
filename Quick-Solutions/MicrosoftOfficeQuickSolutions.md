### Modify default template for Microsoft Word

**Modify the New Document file for Word:** <br/>
Navigate to `%appdata%\Microsoft\Templates`, and open the file `Normal.dotm`.

**Create New Template Based on Your Changes (Preferred):** <br/>
Save file into location of `%userprofile%\Documents\Custom Office Templates` as a dotm (preferred) or dotx file. They will be the exact same size. Remember, dotx, dotx, docx, they're all essentially compressed files, and you can technically renamed them to .zip and extract them, though this won't actually do you any good. Word Documents are also based on HTML.
